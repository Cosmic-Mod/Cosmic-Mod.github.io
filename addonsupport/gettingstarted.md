This page will tell you how to get started on making a datapack for Cosmic Horizons.

Important info for reading these docs:

If a JSON key is followed by a trailing underscore (e.g. `"key_"` but not `"this_key"`), it means that it can be written as anything. (You don't have to include the _ either).
{% capture example_keys %}

So JSON in the docs like:

`"key"`: int

`"key_data"`: int

`"keyname_"`: int

can be written as:

```json
"key": 1
"key_data": 2
"my_key": 3
```

OR

```json
"key": 1
"key_data": 2
"the_fancy_key": 3
```
etc.

{% endcapture %} {% include spoiler.html name="Example" content=example_keys %}
